* The early 1990s recession mainly resulted from Australia's efforts to address excess domestic demand,.curb speculative behaviour in commercial property markets and reduce inflation. Interest rates were increased to a very high level because the transmission of tighter monetary policy took longer than expected to put downward pressure on demand and inflation.

### The influence of different factors on GDP.
.content-box-duke-green[ 
* Because there are missing values in some years of some variables in the original data, which will affect the estimation of the regression model, it is necessary to interpolate the missing values. Here I use the mean to interpolate. At the same time, I deal with the variable `population` in millions of units.

# Continuous

.content-box-soft[ 
* To be specific, every 1 million increase in `population` will reduce GDP by 0.0229%. This may be because the Australian government is unable to provide sufficient employment opportunities and the demographic dividend has not been fully released. 
]

.content-box-soft[ 
* From the perspective of variable `unemployment_with_basic_education`, every 1% increase in the home page rate of people with basic education will increase the GDP growth by 0.38% on average. This may be because the industrial structure in Australia is undergoing adjustment, and some industries are eliminating people with only basic education, thus reducing the labor cost. 
]

.content-box-soft[ 
* Finally, every 1% increase in male unemployment rate will reduce GDP growth by an average of 0.34%, which shows that male workers still dominate all works of life in Australia.

# Conclusion:

.content-box-duke-green[ 
* Through the above model analysis of variables."population", "unemployment rate of basic education" and "unemployment rate of men" have a certain impact on Australia's GDP.
